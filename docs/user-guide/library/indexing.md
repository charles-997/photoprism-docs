# Indexing your originals #

!!! info
    If you're using PhotoPrism for the first time, make sure your photo and video 
    collection is properly configured as *originals* folder.
    See installation instructions in [Getting Started](../../getting-started/index.md) for details.
    When starting with an empty folder, you need to add or upload files first.


1. Go to *Library* using the main navigation

2. Select a sub-folder or keep the default to index all files

3. Select *Complete Rescan* to re-index all originals, including already indexed and unchanged files

4. Press *Start* to start indexing

!!! tip
    You may use [WebDAV](webdav.md) for adding files to the *originals* folder.
    This is especially helpful if PhotoPrism is running on a remote server.

!!! tip 
    A NSFW detector can be enabled to automatically flag pictures as private which 
    may have offensive content. Note that this is only somewhat reliable. 

#### Ignoring directories and files ####

Create a `.ppignore` file in the same directory that the directories or files you want to ignore.
Then put configuration in this file, see the following examples:

```
# ignore a directory by its name
foo
# ignore all files
*.*
# ignore all files with gif extension
*.gif
# ignore videos which name start with MVI
MVI_*.MOV
# or
MVI_*.*
```

Names will be ignored in the directory and all subdirectories. An `*` character will act as a wildcard.

Please note that directories or files will only be ignored if they have not been previously indexed.  If PhotoPrism has already indexed a directory or file, adding it to the `.ppignore` file will not result in the directory or file being removed from PhotoPrism.  If directories or files have already been indexed and you wish for those directories or files to be ignored, you must reset the database by running the command `photoprism reset`.  For more information about resetting the database, refer to [Commands - Reset Database](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/advanced/commands/#reset-db).

#### When should "Complete Rescan" be selected? ####

If selected, all files in the *originals* folder will be re-indexed, including already indexed and unchanged files. 
This may be necessary after upgrading, especially to new major versions.

#### Automatic Indexing ####
The Indexer is triggered automatically 15 Minutes after the originals folder has been edited via WebDAV.
15 Minutes is the default value, it can be changed using the respective [config option](../../getting-started/config-options.md).
